Data passed to ShardDocs is composed of three types of items. Pages, Categories and Links. To
keep the schema as simple as possible, each item shares the same fields and the type is implicitly
determined by the data provided.

**The anatomy of an item**

Each item shares a `name` field and the type of data provided to `content` will determine how the item is treated.

```typescript
type item = {
  name: string;
  content: react.ReactNode | item[] | string;
}
```

**Pages** are created by providing `JSX`. The world's your oyster in what you choose to display here.

```typescript
type page = {
  name: string;
  content: React.ReactNode;
}
```

**Categories** are created by providing an array of items. These are used for grouping items in the sidebar and are infinitely nestable.

```typescript
type category = {
  name: string;
  content: item[];
}
```

**Links** are created by providing a url string. Relative urls will use the internal router, absolute urls will open in a new tab.

```typescript
type link = {
  name: string;
  content: string;
}
```
